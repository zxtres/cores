# Changelog

## Version 280723
First public version for ZXTRES platform. Features:
- All features from ZXUNO project, including optional features (SAA1099, monochrome/green/amber palette, wifi, and many more I can't remember right now :P )
- DisplayPort output (640x480, 60 fps, no sound atm)
- VGA output (640x480, 60 fps)
- I2S and sigma-delta sound output
- Monochrome switcher is activated using key END (FIN on spanish keyboard). Cycles through: colour, green, amber, grayscale
- For A100T and A200T (ZXTRES+ and ZXTRES++ platforms), full line framescaler, so interlace modes are enabled. Key HOME (INICIO on spanish keyboard). 
Cycles through: off, auto, on, blend. Auto and On use full field display (384 lines in paper area). Auto detects whether a gigascreen/interlaced picture is about to be displayed (detects when main/shadow VRAM are switched on every vertical retrace interrupt) and enables full field scan only at
those moments. "On" allows full field at all times. Blend takes the information from both fields and creates a single field screen with colours created by mixing colours from both fields.
